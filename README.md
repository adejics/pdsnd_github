>**My Bikeshare Project**: 
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United States:
1. Chicago,
2. New York City, and 
3. Washington. 

I wrote code to import the data and answer questions about it by 
computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input 
to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Date Created
This project was created on the 9th day of January 2022.

### Project Title
**Explore Bikeshare Data**

### Description
For some years now, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities 
across the world. People interested in renting bicycles on a very short-term basis can now do so for a price. 
This code explores the record of a US company on bikeshare services provided in the New York City, Washington and Chicago.
-----
The project includes a python file which can be run to explore the data contained in the data files for the three cities.

### Files used
In this project, I used data provided by _Motivate_, a bike share system provider for major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare 
the system usage between three large cities: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.** Randomly selected data for the first six 
months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit to those deserving. I sincerely appreciate the beautiful _udacity mentors and tutors_ for the
assistance in carrying out this project. We also appreciate [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com) for making the bikeshare data available.
